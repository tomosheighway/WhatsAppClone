The server used for this project is found here https://github.com/ash-williams/WhatsThat.

Setting up the server:
⦁	Create an empty directory where you want to download the server code into
⦁	Open the directory in a terminal and run “git clone https://github.com/ash-williams/WhatsThat” to download the server code
⦁	Run ‘cd WhatsThat’ to change your directory to the one just downloaded from GitHub
⦁	Run ‘npm install’ to install all of the dependencies. If you have an issue with Python errors, make sure that you have installed Python version 2.7. (Don’t worry about any vulnerabilities that are highlighted)
⦁	Run ‘npm run dev` to start the server. It will tell you that it is listening on port 3333 and you will see that the database tables are created.
⦁   Leave the server running
